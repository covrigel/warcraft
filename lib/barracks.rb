# In most strategy games, like Warcraft III, buildings can also be 
# attacked by Units. Since a Barracks is a building, it has 
# substantially more HP (500). Additionally, a Footman does only half
#  of its AP as damage to a Barracks. This is because they are quite 
#  ineffective against buildings.

# The damage amount should be an integer (Fixnum), but the ceiling 
# (ceil) of the division should be used as the resulting amount.
